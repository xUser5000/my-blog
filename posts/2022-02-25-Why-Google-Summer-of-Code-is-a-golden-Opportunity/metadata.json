{"title": "Why Google Summer of Code is a golden Opportunity", "description": "This article should serve, at least I tried to make it so, as a comprehensive guide for everyone who wants to apply to Google Summer of Code (GSoC for short). Most of the information provided is based on my personal experience in completing Google Summer of Code 2021 at [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/). If your time is so limited, you can just skim through the article by reading the titles and bold phrases. With that said, you are encouraged to read the whole thing because, hopefully, you will gain much more information.", "date": "2022-02-25"}
